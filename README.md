# SCAIR: Strategic and Crowd-Aware Itinerary Recommendation

This repository contains the data for the ECML-PKDD'20 proceedings paper [Strategic and Crowd-aware Itinerary Recommendation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67667-4_5), and its journal extension "Optimizing Group Utility in Itinerary Planning: A Strategic and Crowd-Aware Approach" (Under Review).

## Dataset

The repository includes comprehensive point-of-interest (POI) data from four major Disney theme parks, namely Disney Hollywood Studios (DisHolly), EPCOT (Epcot), California Adventure (CalAdv) and Magic Kingdom (MagicK), providing a robust foundation for evaluating itinerary optimization algorithms in real-world scenarios. The dataset was improved upon the original collection from  [@lim2017personalized](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3077136.3080778?casa_token=AvREC4ZkAJkAAAAA:FYXd8jTJErdpP5ztb4u_lVhJPeyuvypJ-xXe7LLAzIEgCjgiowxYkzcWm3PnDHF8oag8SJil1NJ-VQ), by updating missing or inaccurate data we identified, and adding number of ratings and average scores from Google review. We also re-organized the data into a tabular structure for readability and easy assess.
